## Overview

Focus is a clean, dark-themed task manager that lets you organize your work by priority, track your progress with a live stats bar, and persist everything automatically to localStorage — no backend, no account, no friction.

Built as part of a 3-project React portfolio to demonstrate core React fundamentals including component architecture, hooks, controlled inputs, and derived state.

## React Concepts Demonstrated

- **Functional components** with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Controlled inputs** — form state fully driven by React
- **Derived state** — filter applied at render time, not duplicated in state
- **Side effects** — `useEffect` syncs state to localStorage on every change
- **Props & component composition** — logic in `App`, display in child components
- **Conditional rendering** — empty state and clear button appear contextually
- **List rendering** — stable `key` props on every mapped element
